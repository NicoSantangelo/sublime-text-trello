# Sublime Trello

This is a package for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) that provides a number of useful commands for interacting with Trello (using the [Trello API](https://trello.com/docs/index.html)).

## Usage

Because it's still early in development, the interaction is kind of rough right now, but the idea it's to navigate across your Trello data like [this package](https://github.com/Chris---/SublimeText-File-Navigator).

## Instalation

The package is nowhere near production ready yet, but if you're feeling adventurous you can download the repo in your `/Packages` (*Preferences -> Browse Packages...*) folder and start using/hacking it.

## Known issues

[Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) is required for Linux users (it should be on:
`/usr/local/sbin`, `/sbin`,  `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or `/bin`).
