Hello! sorry for the interruption

Trello has two new top level commands, 'Quick create card' and 'Create card with description'

If you choose any of those commands, the package will create a Card on the last active List.
The active List refers to the last List viewed using the `Trello: Navigate` command.

If you didn't use `Navigate` yet the package will display a panel explaining the situation.

That's all, thanks!
